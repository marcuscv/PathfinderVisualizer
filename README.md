ReactJS web app that visualizes  the behavior of Dijkstra’s algorithm in a grid between a starting node and a target node. 
The user can place block nodes in the grid, and the algorithm avoids these block nodes during its search.
The web app highlights the shortest path if there is a path between the starting node and the target node.

Example shown below:
